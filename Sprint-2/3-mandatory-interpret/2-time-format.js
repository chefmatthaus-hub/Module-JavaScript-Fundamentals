// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
// i) There are 6 variable declarations. 
// Lines 1 (movieLength), 
// Line 3(remainingSeconds), 
// Line 4(totalMinutes), 
// Line 6(remainingMinutes,
// Line 7(totalHours) 
// Line 9(timeRemainingHHMMSS)

// b) How many function calls are there?
// ii) There is only one function call. Line 10

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators
// iii) the % is a remainder operator telling us how many remaining seconds are left in the variable decleration in line 1

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
// iv) line 4 is taking the movieLength 8784 - remainingSeconds 24 which leaves us with a whole value of 146 for the totalMinutes variable decleration.

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
// v) It represents the total time remaining in HH:MM:SS format, perhaps changing variable decleration to timeRemainingHHMMSS would be more descriptive in what we are trying to achieve?

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
// vi) this code won't work for negative number values and non-numeric values, I noticed that single-digit values don't follow the HHMMSS it shows HMSS depending on the value input used such as movieLength = 52.
