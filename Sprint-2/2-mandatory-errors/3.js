// The last4Digits variable should store the last 4 digits of cardNumber
// However, the code isn't working
// Before running the code, make and explain a prediction about why the code won't work
// The .slice() can't be called using numeric values only string values
// Then run the code and see what error it gives.
// This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
//TypeError: cardNumber.slice is not a function
// Consider: Why does it give this error? Is this what I predicted? If not, what's different?
// Then try updating the expression last4Digits is assigned to, in order to get the correct value
